# Northwind-SQLite3

This is a version of the Microsoft Access 2000 Northwind sample database, re-engineered for SQLite3.

The Northwind sample database was provided with Microsoft Access as a tutorial schema for managing small business customers, orders, inventory, purchasing, suppliers, shipping, and employees. Northwind is an excellent tutorial schema for a small-business ERP, with customers, orders, inventory, purchasing, suppliers, shipping, employees, and single-entry accounting.

All the TABLES and VIEWS from the MSSQL-2000 version have been converted to Sqlite3 and included here. Included is a single version prepopulated with data. Should you decide to, you can use the included python script to pump the database full of more data.
